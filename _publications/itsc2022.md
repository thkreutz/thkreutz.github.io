title: "Unsupervised Driving Event Discovery based on Vehicle CAN-Data"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/itsc2022
excerpt: "The data collected from a vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN) can quickly exceed human analysis or annotation capabilities when considering fleets of vehicles, which stresses the importance of unsupervised machine learning methods. This work presents a simultaneous clustering and segmentation approach for vehicle CAN-data that identifies common driving events in an unsupervised manner. The approach builds on self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series to distinguish different driving events in the learned latent space. We evaluate our approach with a dataset of real Tesla Model 3 vehicle CAN-data and a two-hour driving session that we annotated with different driving events. With our approach, we evaluate the applicability of recent time series-related contrastive and generative SSL techniques to learn representations that distinguish driving events. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative SSL methods for driving event discovery, we find that contrastive learning approaches reach similar performance."
