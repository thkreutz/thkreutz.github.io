I am a third year PhD student at the Technical University of Darmstadt. My main research interests are unsupervised machine learning methods and deep generative models. My work evolves around applying these kinds of methods for scene understanding in urban environments. Check out my publications if you are interested in my work.

My research summarized in a short paragraph. 
======
Urban environments present dynamic and complex challenges for autonomous systems and simulations, requiring a deep understanding of scene structure, object behavior, and the ability to generate realistic data for future planning and testing. However, traditional methods rely heavily on annotated data and multimodal inputs, which are costly to obtain and often limited in availability. To address these challenges, my PhD research focuses on advancing unsupervised learning methods for scene understanding and controllable data generation in urban settings, moving towards a framework that allows for a comprehensive scene representation without reliance on extensive manual annotations.
