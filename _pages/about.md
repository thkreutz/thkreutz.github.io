Hi! I am a PhD student (02-2022-?) at the Technical University of Darmstadt. My main research interests are unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g., clustering, SSL, disentangled representation learning) and deep generative models. My work evolves around applying these kinds of methods for scene understanding in urban environments. In this context, I mainly work with perception tasks (motion segmentation, semantic segmentation), crowd simulation, and snythetic data generation. Data modalities span LiDAR point cloud (videos), images, and (multivariate) time series data. Check out my publications if you are interested in my work.
